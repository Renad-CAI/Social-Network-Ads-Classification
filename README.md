# Social Network Ads Classifier

This project uses machine learning to predict whether individuals in a social network will purchase a product based on their age and estimated salary. It includes the following key components:

- **Data Preparation:** The dataset is loaded and explored to understand its contents.

- **Feature Selection and Preprocessing:** The relevant features and the target variable are selected.
- The data is split into training and test sets, and feature scaling is applied.

- **Logistic Regression:** A logistic regression model is trained and evaluated. Decision boundaries are visualized.

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** An SVM model is trained and evaluated. Decision boundaries are visualized.

- **Model Comparison:** The accuracy of logistic regression and SVM models is compared, and a bar chart visualizes the results.

- **Voting Classifier:** A voting classifier combines logistic regression and SVM. The combined model is evaluated, and decision boundaries are visualized.

- **Model Comparison (Voting Classifier):** The accuracy of the voting classifier is compared to individual models, and a bar chart displays the results.

- **Visualizing Probabilities:** Class probabilities are shown for SVM, logistic regression, and the voting classifier for a given sample.

## Requirements

The project requires Python libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. 

Ensure these libraries are installed in your environment.
